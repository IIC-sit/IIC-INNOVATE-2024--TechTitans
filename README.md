### Project Description

Our project aims to address the challenges faced by farmers in the agricultural sector, including exploitation by middlemen, limited market access, pricing inconsistencies, logistical inefficiencies, and delayed payments. We plan to create a **Digital Platform** that directly connects farmers to buyers, ensuring fair prices, improved market access, and a more efficient supply chain. 

Key features of the platform include real-time price monitoring, secure payment systems, educational resources on sustainable farming practices, demand forecasting, and logistics integration. This will empower farmers to make informed decisions, reduce post-harvest losses, and improve financial stability by eliminating middlemen.
